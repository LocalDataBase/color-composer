# Color Composer 
### Tool for visual designers, filmmakers, and artists.

The human eye, although it reads attractiveness intuitively, still requires knowledge to build this "attractiveness", which is obtained through practice and analysis. Even knowing these rules/theories, it may still be difficult for a beginner to immediately apply them in practice.

Things like composition/color balance in a scene are obvious to experienced professionals, as they have a trained **eye**.

That's why I created a tool that helps to improve your vision (and also because I like to `visualize information/data`). The tool analyzes any image, be it a **`scene/object/design/interior/photograph`**, and gives you the opportunity to `disassemble` your own or other people's work according to some rules:
- `60-30-10 Color Rule`
- `Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Shapes Theory`

## 60-30-10 Color Rule

The **60/30/10** rule is a visual design principle used to create balanced and emotionally resonant compositions through color. 

It divides color usage into:
- **60%** — Dominant color (atmosphere/background)
- **30%** — Secondary color (support/contrast)
- **10%** — Accent color (focus/emotion)

This rule is widely used in cinematography to guide mood and storytelling.

Also common in UI/UX design, interior design, photography, and scene building, this rule helps create visual harmony with clear hierarchy.

## Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Shapes Theory

Just like with color, strong compositions often follow a hierarchy of shapes — using a deliberate mix of:
- **Primary** (large) shapes — the main mass or silhouette
- **Secondary** (medium) forms — supportive structure or breakup
- **Tertiary** (small) details — accents, texture, polish

This "big-medium-small" distribution creates visual rhythm, contrast, and readability at a glance.

**`Spot Mode X` allows you to analyze your work in more detail manually, analyzing not only the color, but also the "filling" of the composition.**

There are differences in how the computer and the human eye `"read"` the picture. We catch the context and have the ability to complete the picture. In the `example` below, we understand that there is a red back behind the characters, and the dark areas on the left and bottom right are a bus, so with *Spot Mode X* we help the computer designate the context.

- Set your own Primary, Secondary, and Accent colors (via Color Selection).
- Left click to draw objects on the image (trace with your mouse, press Enter to finish). `one more left click resets trace`
- In the Manual Color Assignment panel, manually assign a role (Primary/Secondary/Accent) to each object.
- Click Analyze to see distribution based on your chosen colors.

## Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Shapes Theory

The application is not limited to movie scenes. Here are a couple of visual analyses of **Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Shapes Theory** in **`3D`** by Gleb Alexandrov and a reproduced analysis using my tool.
